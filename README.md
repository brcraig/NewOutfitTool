# NewOutfitTool
I had to pray to every god imaginable to get this to finally work
so please ignore the weird comments and naming conventions.
When pulling, do it all from the Resurrection branch because one
time I tried merging them and everything dissapeared(hence the name rescurrection)
so just pretend like main does not exist. I could not figure out how to get the
git ignore to work, so I manually added the folders that I did not want to
be ignored into the Resurrection branch. If you are reading this Prate, I swear 
that Sam did actually do her fair share of the project, we just had to make
a new repo because the other one was giving us trouble and not letting either
of us upload anything :).
